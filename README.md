# QQPlotter

QQplots have never really made intuitive sense to me, so I made this interactive visualization tool. I'm still usually confused, but now I have an app for it.

## Use it
1. Clone repo
2. Install necessary packages if not already installed (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, PyQt5, scipy)
3. `python plot.py`
